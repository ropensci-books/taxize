Some of the use cases covered in taxize: Taxonomic identifier from a taxonomic name Taxonomic name from a taxonomic identifier Taxonomic name from a vernacular name Vernacular name from a taxonomic name Taxonomic hierarchy/classification from identifier or name Children of an identifier or name Immediate names above an identifier or name All taxa downstream to a certain rank from identifier or name Taxonomic name synonyms from identifier or name Lowest common taxon and rank for an identifier or name Resolve taxonomic names, i.e., fix spelling errors Make a taxonomic tree from identifiers or names 2.2 Related tools For other related packages see Other packages "],

["authentication.html", "Chapter 4 Authentication", " Chapter 4 Authentication First, what is an API? An API is an Application Programming Interface. The term “API” can be used for lots of scenarios, but in this case we’re talking about web APIs, or APIs (interfaces) to web resources. taxize interacts with remote databases on the web via their APIs. You don’t need to worry about the details of how that all works; just know that some of them require authentication and some do not. Some data sources in taxize require authentication. Here’s a breakdown of which ones require authentication, and how to do authentication by data source: Tropicos: Request a Tropicos API key from http://services.tropicos.org/help?requestkey. EOL: Request an EOL API key at https://eol.org/users/sign_up NCBI Entrez: From NCBI’s docs: “E-utils users are allowed 3 requests/second without an API key. Create an API key (in your account at https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/account/) to increase your e-utils limit to 10 requests/second. Contact our help department (eutilities@ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) if you need higher throughput. Only one API Key per user. Replacing or deleting will inactivate the current key. Refer to documentation (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK25497/) for more.” IUCN: Request an API key at http://apiv3.iucnredlist.org/api/v3/token. Note that some users have reported waiting many weeks for a key. Save your API keys as the following names either as R options or environment variables: Tropicos: ‘TROPICOS_KEY’ EOL: ‘EOL_KEY’ IUCN: ‘IUCN_REDLIST_KEY’ ENTREZ: ‘ENTREZ_KEY’ We’ll read in your keys if we can find them in either R options or environment variables. See ?Startup in R for details on how to store R options or environment variables. We recommend using environment variables (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environment_variable) over R options in general. An added bonus of using environment variables is that they are widley used across programming languages and computing environments. When in R, taxize helper functions are provided to help you obtain and setup API keys for each data source that requires them: taxize::use_tropicos() taxize::use_eol() taxize::use_entrez() taxize::use_iucn() "],
["identifiers.html", "Chapter 5 Identifiers 5.1 get functions 5.2 get functions return objects 5.3 identifier notes 5.4 Looking up taxa on the web", " Chapter 5 Identifiers Taxonomic identifiers are a central concept in taxize - and around which many things depend on. We often either need to get to an identifier for each name the user has, or take an identifier to do something else, for example to get a taxonomic classification. 5.1 get functions There’s a family of functions, each targeted at a specific data source, for getting taxonomic identifiers from names. They all start with the prefix get_, and end with an abbreviation for the data source. They are: get_wiki get_gbifid get_iucn get_natservid get_colid get_boldid get_nbnid get_tsn get_wormsid get_ids get_pow get_uid get_ubioid get_tolid get_tpsid get_eolid Another set of related functions with a trailing underscore (e.g., get_uid_()) are available for all data sources, but they do not do interactive usage, but instead provide all data. 5.2 get functions return objects The returned data from get_* functions is either an NA if no match, or a character string or numeric if a match. The length can be greater than one as all the functions are vectorized. There are a number of attributes attached to the output, where each attributes length equals the length of the id vector: class: the class of the object match: whether a match was found or not multiple_matches: whether there were multiple matches or not pattern_match: whether there was a match by pattern (i.e., regex) uri: the URI/URL for the taxon An example return from a get_* function: [1] &quot;50157568&quot; attr(,&quot;class&quot;) [1] &quot;tpsid&quot; attr(,&quot;match&quot;) [1] &quot;found&quot; attr(,&quot;multiple_matches&quot;) [1] TRUE attr(,&quot;pattern_match&quot;) [1] FALSE attr(,&quot;uri&quot;) [1] &quot;http://tropicos.org/Name/50157568&quot; 5.3 identifier notes Taxonomic identifiers are unique to the data source. That is, the taxonomic ID for any individual taxon in data source A is different from that in data source B, and different from that in data source C, etc. For example, the taxonomic ID for Pinus contorta in NCBI is 3339, the ID in ITIS is 183327, and the ID in COL is 13c40c3f2be0b0965bddf948d2b3115f. Taxonomic identifiers vary among data sources in their structure. That is, some are numeric (only numbers), some are alphanumeric (combination of numbers and letters), and one has an odd structure with letters, numbers and symbols (Nature Serve, e.g., ELEMENT_GLOBAL.2.147775). Most data sources provide numeric identifiers. Wikipedia is unusual in that there are no numeric/alphanumeric/etc. taxonomic identifiers for each name - instead they use an “identifier” that is the name. … 5.4 Looking up taxa on the web If you want to look up the taxon page for any taxa that you’ve passed through get_* functions you can do so by using the uri returned from the function. For example: x &lt;- get_tsn(&#39;Pinus contorta&#39;) browseURL(attr(x, &#39;uri&#39;)) "],
["classification.html", "Chapter 6 Classification 6.1 Usage 6.2 Other sections? 6.3 Related", " Chapter 6 Classification The classification() function is one of the workhorses of the taxize package. A taxonomic classification - or hierarchy - is a fundamental set of information about any taxon. Biological taxonomy is arranged in a hierarchical fashion, with each species taxon name fitting into genera, and genera fitting into families, and so on all the way up to just a few categories of very high level organization. 6.1 Usage library(taxize) classification() has a number of high level features: It is vectorized. That is, it accepts any number of inputs and the output length should equal the input length It accepts various inputs: Taxonomic names as character strings Taxonomic identifiers as character stings or numeric values Any output of the various get_*() functions When there is data available, it always returns a data.frame, facilitating use downstream 6.2 Other sections? asdfadfasdf 6.3 Related Related functions include (note to self: link to these sections when available): children downstream upstream lowest_common "],
