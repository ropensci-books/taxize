has more functionality for dealing with that specific data source.

## related packages {#related-packages}

[taxizesoap][] is no longer maintained. It was maintained for a number of years,
with functionality for handling web services that used the [SOAP protocol][soap],
an older web service protocol that has been largeley replaced with other protocols.
Most if not all data sources that were in taxizesoap have been moved to taxize.
